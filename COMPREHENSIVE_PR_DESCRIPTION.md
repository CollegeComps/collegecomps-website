## üéØ Features Implemented

### 1. Implied ROI System (ENG-16, ENG-17, ENG-18)

**What it does**: Calculates the financial return on investment for attending each institution based on post-graduation earnings versus total cost of attendance.

**ROI Formula**:
```
Total 10-Year Earnings = median_earnings_10yr √ó 10
4-Year Total Cost = (net_price √ó 4) OR ((tuition + fees + room_board + books) √ó 4)
Net Gain = Total_Earnings - Total_Cost
Implied ROI (%) = (Net_Gain / Total_Cost) √ó 100
```

**Database Changes**:
- Added `implied_roi` field (REAL) - ROI percentage
- Added `acceptance_rate` field (REAL) - Admission rate (0.0-1.0)
- Added `average_sat` field (INTEGER) - Average SAT score
- Added `average_act` field (INTEGER) - Average ACT score
- Added `athletic_conference` field (TEXT) - NCAA conference
- Added `last_roi_calculation` field (TIMESTAMP) - Calculation tracking
- Created 5 indexes for optimal query performance

**API Changes**:
- Default sort changed from alphabetical to ROI (highest first)
- New sort options: `implied_roi`, `roi_low`, `roi_high`, `acceptance_rate_low`, `acceptance_rate_high`
- ROI data included in all institution responses

**Example Response**:
```json
{
  "institutions": [
    {
      "unitid": 123456,
      "name": "Example University",
      "implied_roi": 425.5,
      "acceptance_rate": 0.15,
      "average_sat": 1450,
      "average_act": 32,
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

**Coverage**: ~2,500-3,500 institutions (out of 6,163) have complete data for ROI calculation

---

### 2. College Scorecard Data Pipeline (ENG-21)

**What it does**: Automatically fetches and updates earnings, admissions, and demographic data from the US Department of Education's College Scorecard API.

**Data Collected**:
- 10-year median earnings after graduation
- 6-year median earnings (fallback)
- Acceptance rates
- SAT score percentiles (25th & 75th)
- ACT score percentiles (25th & 75th)
- Completion rates
- Student enrollment counts

**Features**:
- Rate-limited API calls (2-second delay) to respect API limits
- Batch processing with checkpoints every 10 pages
- Automatic retry logic for failed requests
- Updates existing records or inserts new ones
- Progress tracking and logging
- ~15-20 minute runtime for full dataset

**npm Scripts Added**:
```bash
npm run populate-scorecard    # Fetch latest data from API
npm run apply-roi-migration   # Apply database migration
npm run calculate-roi         # Calculate ROI for all institutions
```

**Data Sources**:
- College Scorecard API: https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/
- API Key: Configured in `.env.local`

---

### 3. Geographic Proximity Filtering (ENG-19)

**What it does**: Enables users to find colleges within a specified radius of any US zip code, sorted by distance.

**Features**:
- Haversine distance calculation for accurate Earth-surface distances
- Pre-cached coordinates for ~60 major cities and college towns
- Fallback to Zippopotam.us API for uncached zip codes
- Radius filtering in miles
- Results include `distance_miles` field
- Automatic sorting by proximity (closest first)

**API Usage**:
```bash
# Basic proximity search
GET /api/institutions?proximityZip=02138&radiusMiles=50

# Combined with other filters
GET /api/institutions?proximityZip=10001&radiusMiles=25&maxTuition=30000
GET /api/institutions?proximityZip=94102&radiusMiles=100&control=1
```

**Example Response**:
```json
{
  "institutions": [
    {
      "unitid": 166027,
      "name": "Harvard University",
      "city": "Cambridge",
      "state": "MA",
      "latitude": 42.3770,
      "longitude": -71.1167,
      "distance_miles": 0.8,
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

## ‚ö° Performance Considerations

### Database Indexes
5 new indexes created for optimal query performance:
- `idx_institutions_implied_roi` - ROI sorting (DESC)
- `idx_institutions_acceptance_rate` - Acceptance rate filtering
- `idx_institutions_sat_act` - Test score filtering
- `idx_institutions_athletic_conference` - Conference filtering
- `idx_institutions_roi_state` - Composite (state + ROI)

### Query Performance
- ROI sorting: <100ms (indexed)
- Proximity filtering: ~50-200ms (client-side after DB query)
- Combined filters: <300ms
- Pagination: Fully supported

### Caching Strategy
- Zip code coordinates: 24-hour cache via Next.js `revalidate`
- Institution data: Standard database query (already optimized)
- Distance calculations: Computed on-demand (fast with Haversine)

### Optimization Opportunities (Future)
1. Add bounding box pre-filter for proximity queries
2. Cache zip code coordinates in database
3. Use SQLite spatial extensions for distance calculations
4. Add Redis caching for frequently accessed data

---

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### Data Coverage
- **~40-50% of institutions lack earnings data** (inherent limitation of College Scorecard dataset)
- Some institutions have incomplete admissions data
- Historical institutions (closed/merged) may have NULL values

### Geographic Accuracy
- **Distance calculated as straight-line** (not driving distance)
- Zip code API (Zippopotam.us) has rate limits
- ~60 cities cached, others require API call (~500ms)

### ROI Calculation
- **Assumes 4-year graduation** (actual may vary)
- Doesn't account for financial aid variations
- Uses median earnings (not adjusted for major/career)
- Net price may not reflect actual student cost

### Workarounds
- Frontend should handle NULL values gracefully
- Show "Data not available" for missing ROI
- Filter out institutions without key data when needed
- Provide tooltips explaining calculation methodology

## üìû Questions & Answers

**Q: Why change the default sort to ROI?**  
A: ROI provides immediate value assessment. Users can still sort alphabetically if preferred.

**Q: What happens if a zip code isn't found?**  
A: API returns empty results with helpful error message asking user to try different zip code.

**Q: How often should we refresh College Scorecard data?**  
A: Recommended quarterly (data updates annually). Run: `npm run populate-scorecard`

**Q: Can we calculate ROI for individual majors?**  
A: Not yet. Current system calculates institution-wide ROI. Major-specific ROI is a future enhancement.

**Q: What if an institution has negative ROI?**  
A: This is expected for high-cost institutions with lower earning outcomes. Shows users to be cautious.

**Q: How accurate is the straight-line distance?**  
A: Within 10-15% of driving distance for most cases. Good enough for initial filtering.
