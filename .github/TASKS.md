College Explorer: We should make the landing page for this something other than the alphabetical list below the search bar. What if we showed the list by implied ROI? With an option to further filter the list by asking for: 1) Proximity to zip code, 2) desired major category? (STEM, Humanities, Social Sciences, Arts, Business, Health, Education)

For the sorting College Explorer by average ROI, we may need to assign ROI averages to each school based on the average earnings. Are you able to do that with the current data?

Analytics: Can we create something similar to this scatter plot for the median costs on X axis and ROI (% or $) on the Y axis: https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-college-return-on-investment/?leadSource=uverify wall

Data: Adding acceptance rate. Is it possible to add median earnings 10 years after enrollment?

Data: Adding average SAT/ACT score. Add athletic conference

Data: Under the college overview, add student enrollment size for undergrad vs graduate, as well as male vs female with some basic visualizations (pie charts, etc).
