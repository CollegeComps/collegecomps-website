# CollegeComps Feature Implementation Status

**Last Updated**: October 19, 2025  
**Current Branch**: ENG-19/zip-code-proximity-filter

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. ENG-21: College Scorecard Data Pipeline
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete & Running  
**Branch**: ENG-21/college-scorecard-data-pipeline (pushed)  
**Files Created**:
- `scripts/populate-scorecard-data.js` - Data collection from College Scorecard API
- `scripts/populate-scorecard-data.ts` - TypeScript version
- `scripts/README-populate-scorecard.md` - Documentation

**Features**:

### 2. ENG-16/17/18: Implied ROI System
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete (DB ready, calculation pending data)  
**Branch**: ENG-16/add-implied-roi-field (pushed)  
**Files Created**:
- `database/migrations/002_add_implied_roi_fields.sql` - Schema migration
- `scripts/apply-roi-migration.js` - Migration application
- `scripts/calculate-roi.js` - ROI calculation
- `scripts/fix-migration.js` - Manual column fix
- `database/README-ROI-SYSTEM.md` - Complete documentation
- `PR_DESCRIPTION_ENG16-17-18.md` - PR template

**Database Changes**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE institutions ADD COLUMN implied_roi REAL;
ALTER TABLE institutions ADD COLUMN acceptance_rate REAL;
ALTER TABLE institutions ADD COLUMN average_sat INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE institutions ADD COLUMN average_act INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE institutions ADD COLUMN athletic_conference TEXT;
ALTER TABLE institutions ADD COLUMN last_roi_calculation TIMESTAMP;

-- Indexes created
idx_institutions_implied_roi
idx_institutions_acceptance_rate
idx_institutions_sat_act
idx_institutions_athletic_conference
idx_institutions_roi_state
```

**ROI Formula**:
```
Total 10-Year Earnings = median_earnings_10yr * 10
4-Year Total Cost = (net_price * 4) OR ((tuition + fees + room_board + books) * 4)
Net Gain = Total_Earnings - Total_Cost
Implied ROI (%) = (Net_Gain / Total_Cost) * 100
```

**API Changes**:
- src/app/api/institutions/route.ts - Default sort changed to `implied_roi`
- src/lib/database.ts - Added ROI sorting options

**Pending**: 
- ‚è≥ Waiting for `populate-scorecard` to complete
- ‚è≥ Then run: `npm run calculate-roi`
- ‚è≥ Verify with test queries

      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

**Pending**:

## üß™ Testing Plan

### Unit Tests Needed
- [ ] Haversine distance calculation accuracy
- [ ] ROI calculation formula verification
- [ ] Zip code normalization
- [ ] CIP code mapping (when implemented)

### Integration Tests Needed
- [ ] API endpoint `/api/institutions` - all filter combinations
- [ ] Proximity filter + other filters combined
- [ ] ROI sorting with NULL values
- [ ] Pagination with filtering

### Manual Testing Checklist

#### Proximity Filter
- [ ] Test with major cities (NYC, LA, Chicago)
- [ ] Test with college towns (Cambridge, Princeton)
- [ ] Test with invalid zip codes
- [ ] Test with edge cases (Alaska, Hawaii)
- [ ] Verify distance calculations are reasonable

#### ROI System
- [ ] Verify top 10 ROI institutions make sense
- [ ] Check for negative ROI cases
- [ ] Validate with sample calculations
- [ ] Test sorting options (high to low, low to high)
- [ ] Verify NULL handling

#### Combined Filters
- [ ] Proximity + ROI sorting
- [ ] Proximity + tuition max
- [ ] Proximity + public/private filter
- [ ] State + ROI + proximity

## üìä Database Statistics (Expected After Data Population)

```sql
-- Total institutions
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM institutions;
-- Expected: ~6,163

-- Institutions with earnings data
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM earnings_outcomes;
-- Expected: ~3,000-4,000

-- Institutions with admissions data
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM admissions_data;
-- Expected: ~2,000-3,000

-- Institutions with ROI (after calculation)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM institutions WHERE implied_roi IS NOT NULL;
-- Expected: ~2,500-3,500

-- ROI statistics
SELECT 
  ROUND(AVG(implied_roi), 2) as avg_roi,
  ROUND(MIN(implied_roi), 2) as min_roi,
  ROUND(MAX(implied_roi), 2) as max_roi
FROM institutions;
-- Expected: avg ~100-150%, min negative, max 500%+
```

## üîó Branch Status

| Branch | Status | Files Changed | Ready for PR |
|--------|--------|---------------|--------------|
| ENG-21/college-scorecard-data-pipeline | Pushed | 2 | ‚úÖ Yes |
| ENG-16/add-implied-roi-field | Pushed | 6 | ‚úÖ Yes |
| ENG-19/zip-code-proximity-filter | Pushed | 8 | ‚è≥ Pending tests |

## üìù Notes & Considerations

### Performance
- Proximity filtering done client-side (after DB query)
- Consider adding bounding box pre-filter for large datasets
- ROI sorting uses indexed column (fast)
- Pagination works with all filters

### Data Quality
- ~40% of institutions lack earnings data (expected)
- SAT/ACT scores availability varies by institution
- Some institutions may have $0 net price (full scholarships)
- Handle NULL values gracefully in all calculations

### Future Optimizations
1. **Zip Code Database**: Pre-load all US zip codes for instant lookup
2. **Spatial Queries**: Use SQLite spatial extensions for distance calculations
3. **Caching**: Redis cache for frequently accessed data
4. **CDN**: Static data (zip coordinates, CIP mappings) via CDN

## ‚ú® Summary

**Completed**: 3 major features (ROI system, data pipeline, proximity filter)  
**In Progress**: Data population running in background  
**Next Up**: Major category filter (ENG-20)  
**ETA to Complete All**: ~8-12 hours of development time  

**Current Blocker**: Waiting for data population to complete before testing ROI features

**Recommendation**: Continue with ENG-20 (Major Category Filter) while data populates, then test everything together once data is ready.
