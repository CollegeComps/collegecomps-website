## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### 1. **Resend Email Integration** 
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete  
**Files Modified**: 
- `src/app/api/auth/forgot-password/route.ts`
- `package.json`, `package-lock.json`

**Changes**:
- Installed Resend package (`resend@^4.0.0`)
- Added professional HTML email template with CollegeComps branding
- Integrated email sending in forgot-password API
- Email includes reset link with 1-hour expiry
- Proper error handling (doesn't reveal email send failures for security)

**Action Required**:
```bash
# Add to Vercel environment variables:
RESEND_API_KEY=re_6z8nZt29_DZGk9pudXJpZkDbKXSXLAdQm
```

**Testing**:
- Test forgot password flow after deployment
- Verify email delivery to inbox
- Check reset link works and expires after 1 hour

### 2. **Degree Search Returns Wrong Results**
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete  
**Files Modified**: 
- `src/app/api/programs/search/route.ts`

**Problem**:
- Query "Computer" returned "Biology/Biological Sciences, General"
- Query "Nursing" returned "Psychology, General"
- FTS5 search was too permissive, matching unrelated terms

**Solution**:
- Changed from loose FTS5 matching to **phrase search with quotes**
- Split query into terms and require ALL terms to be present
- Each term now wrapped in quotes: `"computer"` instead of `computer`
- Better AND logic ensures all search terms must match

**Before**:
```typescript
const ftsQuery = query.replace(/[^\w\s]/g, '').trim();
// Just cleaned special chars
```

**After**:
```typescript
const searchTerms = query.toLowerCase().trim().split(/\s+/).filter(t => t.length > 0);
const ftsQuery = searchTerms.map(term => `"${term}"`).join(' ');
// Creates: "computer" "science" (requires both terms)
```

**Testing After Deployment**:
```bash
# Should return Computer Science programs:
curl "https://www.collegecomps.com/api/programs/search?q=Computer"

# Should return Nursing programs:
curl "https://www.collegecomps.com/api/programs/search?q=Nursing"

# Should return Business programs:
curl "https://www.collegecomps.com/api/programs/search?q=Business"
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete  
**Files Modified**:

**Solution**:

// Before:
<div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
