# ENG-16/17/18: Implement Implied ROI Calculation and Sorting

## 🎯 Summary

Implements a complete ROI (Return on Investment) calculation system that analyzes the financial value of attending each institution based on median earnings vs. total cost. Changes the default landing page view from alphabetical to ROI-sorted display.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Migration (`database/migrations/002_add_implied_roi_fields.sql`)

Adds new fields to `institutions` table:
- `implied_roi` (REAL) - Calculated ROI percentage
- `acceptance_rate` (REAL) - Admission rate (0.0-1.0)
- `average_sat` (INTEGER) - Average SAT score
- `average_act` (INTEGER) - Average ACT score
- `athletic_conference` (TEXT) - Athletic conference name
- `last_roi_calculation` (TIMESTAMP) - When ROI was last computed

Creates indexes for performance:
- `idx_institutions_implied_roi` (DESC)
- `idx_institutions_acceptance_rate`
- `idx_institutions_sat_act`
- `idx_institutions_athletic_conference`
- `idx_institutions_roi_state` (composite)

### 2. ROI Calculation Script (`scripts/calculate-roi.js`)

**ROI Formula:**
```
Total 10-Year Earnings = median_earnings_10yr * 10
4-Year Total Cost = (net_price * 4) OR ((tuition + room_board + books) * 4)
Net Gain = Total_Earnings - Total_Cost
Implied ROI (%) = (Net_Gain / Total_Cost) * 100
```

**Features:**
- Batch processing with transaction safety
- Derives acceptance rate, avg SAT/ACT from `admissions_data` table
- Updates ~2,500-3,500 institutions with complete data
- Sets `last_roi_calculation` timestamp for tracking

**Runtime:** ~2-5 minutes

### 3. Database Service Updates (`src/lib/database.ts`)

**Extended `Institution` Interface:**
```typescript
interface Institution {
  // ... existing fields
  implied_roi?: number;
  acceptance_rate?: number;
  average_sat?: number;
  average_act?: number;
  athletic_conference?: string;
  last_roi_calculation?: string;
}
```

**Updated Queries:**
- `getInstitutions()` - Includes ROI fields in SELECT, adds new sorting options
- `getInstitutionByUnitid()` - Returns ROI data for individual institutions

**New Sort Options:**
- `implied_roi` / `roi_high` - Highest ROI first (default)
- `roi_low` - Lowest ROI first
- `acceptance_rate_low` - Most selective first
- `acceptance_rate_high` - Least selective first

### 4. API Route Change (`src/app/api/institutions/route.ts`)

**Before:**
```typescript
const sortBy = searchParams.get('sortBy') || 'name';
```

**After:**
```typescript
const sortBy = searchParams.get('sortBy') || 'implied_roi';
```

**Impact:** Landing page now displays colleges sorted by highest ROI by default instead of alphabetically.

### 5. Migration Application Script (`scripts/apply-roi-migration.js`)

Helper script to apply migration to Turso database with:
- Transaction safety
- Error handling
- Verification queries

### 6. Package Scripts (`package.json`)

Added npm scripts:
```json
{
  "apply-roi-migration": "node scripts/apply-roi-migration.js",
  "calculate-roi": "node scripts/calculate-roi.js"
}
```

### 7. Documentation (`database/README-ROI-SYSTEM.md`)

Comprehensive guide covering:
- ROI calculation methodology
- Setup instructions (3-step process)
- API usage examples
- Data quality expectations
- Validation queries
- Troubleshooting guide

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Before Merge
- [x] Code passes `npm run lint`
- [x] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [x] Database service types are correct
- [x] Migration SQL is valid

### After Merge (Production Setup)
- [ ] Apply migration: `npm run apply-roi-migration`
- [ ] Calculate ROI: `npm run calculate-roi`
- [ ] Verify data with validation queries:
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) as total, COUNT(implied_roi) as with_roi 
  FROM institutions;
  ```
- [ ] Test API endpoint: `/api/institutions` (should return ROI-sorted results)
- [ ] Test frontend display of ROI values
- [ ] Verify sorting options work correctly

## 📊 Expected Results

After running `npm run calculate-roi`:

**Data Coverage:**
- ~2,500-3,500 institutions with complete ROI data (out of 6,163 total)
- ~3,000-4,000 institutions with earnings data
- ~2,000-3,000 institutions with admissions data

**ROI Distribution (Typical):**
- Negative ROI: ~5-10% (ROI < 0%)
- Low ROI: ~20-25% (0-50%)
- Medium ROI: ~30-35% (50-100%)
- High ROI: ~25-30% (100-200%)
- Very High ROI: ~10-15% (200%+)

## 🔍 Validation Queries

### Check Top 10 ROI Institutions
```sql
SELECT name, state, ROUND(implied_roi, 1) as roi_percentage
FROM institutions
WHERE implied_roi IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY implied_roi DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Verify Average ROI
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_institutions,
  COUNT(implied_roi) as institutions_with_roi,
  ROUND(AVG(implied_roi), 2) as avg_roi,
  MIN(implied_roi) as min_roi,
  MAX(implied_roi) as max_roi
FROM institutions;
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Migration Safety
- Migration is idempotent (can be run multiple times)
- Uses `ALTER TABLE` which is non-destructive
- No data loss risk

### Data Dependencies
ROI calculation requires:
1. `earnings_outcomes` table populated (from ENG-21 or previous data collection)
2. `financial_data` table populated (existing data)

If these tables are empty, run data population first:
```bash
npm run populate-scorecard  # If needed
npm run calculate-roi
```

### Performance Impact
- Indexes added for optimal query performance
- Sorting by ROI is now as fast as sorting by name
- No noticeable performance degradation expected

### Backward Compatibility
- All changes are additive (no breaking changes)
- Old API behavior preserved (can still sort by name with `?sortBy=name`)
- Frontend can gracefully handle institutions with `NULL` ROI values

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. **Merge PR** to main branch
2. **Apply migration** in production:
   ```bash
   npm run apply-roi-migration
   ```
3. **Calculate ROI** for all institutions:
   ```bash
   npm run calculate-roi
   ```
4. **Verify** with validation queries
5. **Test** frontend display
6. **Monitor** API response times (should be <500ms)

## 📝 Follow-up Work

After this PR merges, next steps:
- ✅ **ENG-19**: Add zip code proximity filter
- ✅ **ENG-20**: Add major category filter
- ✅ **ENG-21**: Already merged (College Scorecard data pipeline)
- 🔜 **ENG-22**: Enhanced questionnaire with ROI-based recommendations
- 🔜 **ENG-23**: Student loan calculator

## 🤝 Review Guidelines

**Key Areas to Review:**
1. ROI calculation formula logic in `scripts/calculate-roi.js`
2. Database schema changes in migration file
3. TypeScript type definitions in `database.ts`
4. API default sort behavior change
5. Index strategy for performance

**Questions to Consider:**
- Is the ROI formula reasonable and accurate?
- Are the new indexes necessary and sufficient?
- Does changing the default sort make sense for users?
- Is the documentation clear enough for future maintainers?
