# Historical Trends Dashboard - Improvements & Data Strategy

## ✅ What We Fixed

### 1. **Multi-Year Trend Generation**
**Problem**: Database only had 1 year (2023) of financial data, causing only 1 data point to show
**Solution**: Generate synthetic historical trends using industry-standard rates:
- **Cost Inflation**: 4% annually (historical college cost average)
- **Salary Growth**: 3% annually (national average)
- **Base Salary**: $60,000 (national median for bachelor's degree holders)

Now shows 5 years of trend data by default (configurable via `?years=X` parameter)

### 2. **Industry Growth Trends**
**Problem**: Industry growth section was empty
**Solution**: Query `academic_programs` table for top fields by:
- **Total Completions**: Sum of all graduates in that field
- **School Count**: Number of schools offering the program
- **Average Completions**: Mean completions per school

Shows top 10 programs with the most graduates, indicating high-demand fields

### 3. **User Salary Data Integration**
**Problem**: No real salary data, only estimates
**Solution**: Integrate user-submitted salary data when available:
- Query `salary_submissions` table for approved submissions
- Calculate average salary from real user data
- Use this to enhance base salary calculations
- Falls back to national median if no submissions exist

### 4. **Enhanced Error Logging**
Added detailed logging at each step:
- Database connection status
- Query execution progress
- Data point counts
- Response generation

## 📊 Current Data Status

### Financial Data (College DB)
```
financial_data: 3,825 schools, YEAR 2023 only
academic_programs: 9M+ records, YEAR 2022 only
earnings_outcomes: 0 records (empty)
institutions: 3,825+ schools
```

### User Data (Users DB)
```
salary_submissions: 0 submissions (need users to contribute)
users: Active user base
```

## 🚀 How to Improve Data Quality

### Option 1: Import Historical Financial Data (Recommended)
**Goal**: Get 5+ years of actual cost data (2019-2023)

**Data Sources**:
- IPEDS (Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System)
- College Scorecard API
- Your existing scraper with year parameter

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Update scraper to fetch multiple years
cd collegecomps-scraper
# Modify scripts to loop through years 2019-2023
# Import into Turso database
turso db shell collegecomps < multi_year_financial_data.sql
```

### Option 2: Import Earnings Data
**Goal**: Get actual salary outcomes by program/school

**Data Sources**:
- College Scorecard earnings data
- PayScale data (if accessible)
- Bureau of Labor Statistics

**Benefits**:
- Real ROI calculations
- Accurate salary projections
- Better career outcome insights

### Option 3: Encourage User Salary Submissions
**Goal**: Build crowdsourced salary database

**Current Schema** (`salary_submissions`):
- institution_name, major, degree_level
- graduation_year, years_since_graduation
- current_salary, total_compensation
- job_title, industry, location
- is_approved, is_public

**Implementation Ideas**:
1. Add salary submission form to dashboard
2. Incentivize submissions (unlock premium features)
3. Show aggregate stats to encourage participation
4. Admin approval workflow for quality control
