# Future Improvements & Investigation Tasks

## B. Historical Trends Performance Deep Dive

### Investigation Tasks:
- [ ] **Profile Frontend Rendering**
  - Measure time spent rendering charts vs data fetching
  - Check if Recharts library is causing slowdowns
  - Profile React component re-renders
  - Measure time for each chart to render

- [ ] **API Response Time Analysis**
  - Add detailed timing logs to historical trends API
  - Measure cold start vs cached responses
  - Check if Turso connection latency is an issue
  - Test with different year ranges (5 vs 7 vs 10 years)

- [ ] **Frontend Optimization Options**
  - Consider lazy loading charts (render on scroll)
  - Implement chart data memoization
  - Use React.memo() for chart components
  - Consider switching to lighter charting library (Chart.js, Victory)
  - Add progressive loading (show basic data first, then details)

- [ ] **Backend Optimization Options**
  - Pre-calculate trend data and store in cache table
  - Use Redis/Upstash for faster caching instead of in-memory
  - Consider moving to edge functions for faster response times
  - Generate static trend reports daily via cron job

- [ ] **Database Optimization**
  - Create additional indexes on trend-related queries
  - Add materialized views for common trend calculations
  - Check if views are actually being used (query plan analysis)
  - Consider denormalizing frequently accessed data

### Success Metrics:
- Target: < 2 seconds total load time
- Target: < 500ms API response time
- Target: < 1.5 seconds rendering time
