  ]
}
```
**Analysis**: âœ… Exact matches (relevance: 1) appear first, then contains matches

---

### Search Algorithm Improvements âœ…

**Before Fix**:
- Used FTS5 full-text search with loose tokenization
- "Computer" matched "Biology" because of tokenization issues
- "Nursing" returned completely unrelated programs

**After Fix**:
- Uses LIKE-based search with AND logic
- All search terms must be present in program title
- Relevance ranking: exact match â†’ starts with â†’ contains
- Predictable, accurate results every time

**Code Change**:
```typescript
// OLD: FTS5 with unpredictable tokenization
WHERE programs_fts MATCH ?

// NEW: LIKE with AND logic
WHERE LOWER(cip_title) LIKE '%computer%'
```

```
https://collegecomps-website.vercel.app/auth/reset-password?token=...
```

**After**:
```

```

**Implementation**:
```typescript

  ? 'https://www.collegecomps.com' 
  : (process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL || 'http://localhost:3000');
```
